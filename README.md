# Your News

A website thats meant to show news from multiple sources and give the user a way to research the topic and view the original source.

# Motivation

I was tired of having to go to multiple websites to get a full idea of the news so I made a custom feed mor myself. If I ever want to research the topic or see if its fake I'll typically google the title so I made a button to automate the process.
